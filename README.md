# Top-200
Test your knowledge of the pharmaceutical top 200 drugs
This is done through two current methods
The first allows you to test yourself on a random selection of the total 200 drugs
The second choice allows you to work on a random selection from increments of 50
The program will then ask you how many drugs to show you
Then it uses a random number generator to pick a drug and decided whether to show the brand or generic
When you enter the answer for the question, spelling accuracy is checked and will be marked wrong if incorrect
The program also currently checks for a given list of brand names for specific generics
